csgoMP (Music Player) lets you select an audio file and converts it to 
a WAV that can be used with the csgo voice_inputfromfile command.  This 
plays the WAV file over in game comms instead of taking input from your 
microphone.

It also writes the cfg files needed to set up keybingings to your csgo 
directory.

Idea taken from the Windows program SLAM: https://github.com/SilentSys/SLAM

Requirements:
- ffmpeg
- python and gtk bindings

Running it
$ ./csgomp.py

(or $ python csgomp.py)

Check the preferences to make sure the paths for ffmpeg and your csgo 
directory are correct.  Optionally set a maximum length for the converted 
audio file.

Add audio file(s) to the list.  The file types supported depends on how your 
ffmpeg was built.

Click "write csgo cfg" to save the required cfg file to your csgo directory

In game, bring up the console and run: 
] exec csgomp

This will load the cfg and assign the ' and / keys to play your selected audio 
file.  These are currently hardcoded.  The ' key will play the audio while you 
are holding it, and the / key will toggle playback on and off.  If the end of
the file is reached during continuous playback you will need to press / again
to toggle it off - it won't automatically stop transmitting.

In the csgomp main window select one of your audio files on the list, the 
currently highlighted one will be active in game



Todo:
Add option to change keybindings
find and check paths for things, get steam path somehow?
delete files from list
cleanup on exit
cache converted WAV files to speed up switching songs
Pause option, reconvert temp song from current position when paused in game
Allow changing of volume on converted files
Preview of converted file

Bugs:
lots of things not finished
csgo crashes if you try to play the file while it is being converted
